1) Manually turn on simplestore. That way there's no reset delay as the
flash chip turns on and off.
  - Done

2) Make SPI faster
  Bit rate = FSSICLK / (CPSDVR * (1+SCR))
  CPSDVR is in SSI_CPSR
  Most I can set rate to is 10 mhz, which is better than the 2 it was set at.
  - Done

3) Group packets together

On the gateway side:

12 bytes before first versipn number.
3 of those bytes are sequence (1) + preamble (2)
17 bytes total. 12 before first version number + 5 after (4 bytes of time + 1 byte crc or something)
